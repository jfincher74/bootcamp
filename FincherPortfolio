<h2> About Me </h2>	
	
	<p> My name is Jay Fincher. I currently work at GE which is quickly becoming a software company. 
	I graduated from college with a sociology degree and would have never thought that <em>I</em> would be 
	interested in <strong> front-end development </strong> but here I am.</p>
	
	<p> From my pictures, you can probably guess that I have a few things that I am interested in.
		<ol>
			<li>My wife, Megan, is a joy and inspiration for me</li>
			<li>My dog, Dixie, is a great companion and mega study-buddy</li>
			<li>I enjoy being outside </li>	
			<li>I love cities and two cities hold a special place in my heart:
				<ul>
					<li>Detroit</li>
					<li>Denver</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
